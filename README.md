# JavaFX
Games made using JavaFX
I began coding with JavaFX sophomore year in AP Computer Science A.
For my final project I made TicTacToe, and was able to make a two player mode as well as a single player mode with a bot.
After this, I made Hangman with my remaining time in the class. The hangman interface is more refined than that of TicTacToe.
In November 2018, after the Video Game Programming Club had voted to make snake instead my personal choice, Tetris, I went out to make it on my own using JavaFX.
